        "This notebook is designed to convert medical school lecture content from an Excel file into a JSONL format suitable for creating Anki flashcards. The process involves the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Library Imports**: We import the necessary libraries, `pandas` for data manipulation and `json` for handling JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loading Data**: The Excel file containing the lecture slides and corresponding Anki card information is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows us to easily access and manipulate the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **System Message Definition**: We define a system message that sets the context for an AI model. This message describes the model's role as an expert medical professor, emphasizing the importance of high-yield information that frequently appears on medical exams.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Creating JSONL Structure**: We iterate through each row of the DataFrame to create a structured JSON object for each entry. Each entry includes:\n",
        "   - The system message,\n",
        "   - The lecture slide content,\n",
        "   - The corresponding Anki card content.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Writing to JSONL**: The structured data is then written to a JSONL file, with each entry saved on a new line for easy access.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Completion Message**: Finally, a message is printed to confirm that the JSONL file has been successfully created.\n"
